          in your life.</p>
    <p>Ingredients
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Shrimp (or protein of your choice)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped ham</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>Scallions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Steps
        <ol>
            <li>Start by bringing some water to a boil in a pot. Rinse your rice to 
                remove excess starch and then add it to boiling water with a little salt. Cover and 
                place in the oven at 350°F for 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat a wide non-stick pan over medium high heat and add some vegetable oil 
                along with 2 beaten eggs. Move them around until the eggs just turn into curds and remove from
                 the heat into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Wipe out pan, add more oil, and then add the shrimp (or the protein of your choice). Once cooked, set aside in the bowl with the eggs.</li>
            <li>Wipe out pan, add oil again, and then add ½ cup of shiitake mushrooms. Cook for about 2 minutes before adding ½ cup frozen 
                peas and 1 cup chopped ham. Saute to combine.</li>
            <li>Add 2 cloves of crushed garlic and cook for about 30 seconds before adding 4 cups of cooked white rice. In a separate bowl, combine 3 
                Tbsp each of oyster sauce and soy sauce and add to the mixture.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to high and let the whole thing saute. Break up any big chunks of rice and cook for about 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add your eggs and protein back into the mix and top with some sesame oil and thinly sliced scallions. </li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and add some sesame seeds. Mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Finish it off by adding 1 Tbsp of butter and mixing that to combine.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
