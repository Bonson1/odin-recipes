    <p>Steps : Standard Ice Cream
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan combine 2 cups whole milk, two whole eggs, and 1 cup of white sugar. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Make sure pan is under a medium-low heat and whisk until temperature reaches 175°F.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from heat and add ⅓ cup of cocoa powder, or whatever 
                flavor you’d like. Whisk and add 1 ½ cups of heavy cream until fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Place in a metal bowl and put plastic wrap directly on top of the mixture and place in the freezer.</li>
            <li>In a large metal bowl, fill halfway with ice and add ½ a cup of kosher salt. Mix together.</li>
            <li>Remove ice cream mixture from the freezer, remove plastic wrap and set on top of the ice.</li>
            <li>Push the bowl down into the ice so it’s nice and cozy, and start whisking your mixture.
                 Whisk for 10 minutes while scraping down the sides when you can. 
                 Once you’ve whisked for 10 minutes place a clean kitchen towel over the whole mixture and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. 
                 Repeat this 3 more times.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve done the previous step a total of four times, 
                cover your mixture with plastic wrap all the way down to the mixture and freeze for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
